This directory contains the USB driver supporting USB HID and USB storage
devices.

For using the USB driver as input service (supporting USB HID), add
the '<hid/>' tag to the 'usb_drv' configuration. Analogously, for
using the driver as block service, add the '<storage/>' tag.
Both tags can be combined.
